# My Knowledge Base

Welcome to my personal knowledge base!

This is a collection of notes organized by topic.

## Structure

- **algorithms/** - Data structures and algorithms
- **stats/** - Statistics and probability theory

## Getting Started

Create new folders and markdown files to organize your knowledge. All notes support:

- Markdown formatting
- Math equations with LaTeX: $E = mc^2$
- Code blocks with syntax highlighting

## Math Examples

Inline math: The quadratic formula is $x = \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}$

Block math:

$$
\int_0^\infty e^{-x^2} dx = \frac{\sqrt{\pi}}{2}
$$
